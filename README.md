# Bayesian_sliding_window
Code to develop a Bayesian sliding window in Nimble

Emily's notes to self (13.02.26)

- I have finished up the testing script for the Nimble functions and they seem
to be doing what is expected.
- Have done very rough test of the actual code for running the model, which also
seems ok. 

To do:

- Write a proper check script for the model and running model functions.
- Create simulation code to make datasets for the simulation analysis.
- Check script for these simulated datasets.
- Start to run the actual simulations.

NOTE: Intercept is very important, model is struggling with an intercept of 0
perhaps need to mean centre the data so that intercept should be 0.
